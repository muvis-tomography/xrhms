Please note that this version of the code has had some third-party confidential
IP supplied to us under NDA by hardware manufacturers removed from it. While 
efforts have been made to minimize the impact on the main functionality of the 
code, we strongly recommend users to perform their own thorough bug-check and 
edits before attempting to run the code. This will help ensure that any 
potential issues related to the removal of the confidential IP are addressed.
